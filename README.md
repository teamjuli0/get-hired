# Road to Google

This repository is meant for you to join me on my journey as I learn and grow as a developer! Here you'll be able to see my improvements and learning through algorithms and projects I've considered taking on as well as notes on any resources I've found useful on the road to Full-Time!

## (Current) Repo Structure:


```
project
│   README.md  
│
└───algorithms
│   │
│   └───algorithm-1
│   │   │   readme.md
│   │   │   starter.js
│   │   │   solution.js
│   │   
│   └─── ...
│   
└───employer-ready
```

## Personal Goals:

- Create a repo that others can reference and use for their own growth and development
- Overcome Imposter Syndrome
- Become a Full-Time employee
- Become a Full-Time employee at Google
- Gain a deeper understanding of concepts I'm already comfortable with
- Learn new technologies I'm not familiar with such as:
    - *Flutter*
    - *Java*
    - *Swift*
- Help as many people as I can along the way
