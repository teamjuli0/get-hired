# Algorithm

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
at each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The Characters should form a chessboard.

# Examples

## Example 1:

Input:

```javascript
const arg = 8
```

Output:

```javascript
output = `
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
`
```

Explanation:

```
This output alternates between starting with a space and a hashtag for each new line depending on the number being passed in as input
```
