# Algorithm

Define a Function that Returns the nth Line of Pascal's Triangle

# Examples

## Example 1: 
Input:

```javascript
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
```

Output:

```javascript
1 4 6 4 1
```

Explanation:

```
Each element of each row is either 1 or the sum of the two elements right above it which makes the soloution here 
1 4 6 4 1
```

# Constraints
    m == accounts.length
    n == accounts[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 50
    1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100
